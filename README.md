### Problem Statement

Outdoor enthusiasts such as climbers, thru-hikers, backpackers, and mountaineers often struggle to find a dedicated online space to connect, share experiences, and plan adventures. Existing social media platforms are too general, making it difficult to discover relevant content, connect with like-minded individuals, and access reliable, user-generated trail and climbing information.

Additionally, organizing group trips, sharing real-time trail conditions, and discussing gear recommendations are fragmented across multiple forums, social media groups, and outdated websites. This lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform leads to missed networking opportunities, safety concerns due to outdated trail information, and inefficiencies in trip planning.

WildLink aims to solve this problem by providing a dedicated social networking platform designed specifically for outdoor adventurers. The app will enable users to connect based on shared interests, exchange real-time trail and route conditions, share trip reports and gear reviews, and coordinate group expeditionsâ€”all within a single, well-structured environment.
