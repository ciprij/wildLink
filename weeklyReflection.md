# Weekly Reflection

Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, 
as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of 
how things went: achievements and struggles.

### Week 2 - 3 hours

Tasks Completed:
* created project repo on Github
* created project structure in IntelliJ
* Added link to list of indie project in student repo

Overall, I feel I have a decent idea of how I want to tackle the indie project.  
I've come up with a topic idea that I'm pretty excited and nervous about but it'll
be cool to finally put together all of the concepts we've covered over the semesters
to build something that will be pretty cool!

### Week 3 - 4 hours

Tasks Completed:
* created wireframes
* worked on filling out the Project Plan (still have a lot to review and come up with)
* completed creating some user stories; may come up with more
* denoted MVP user stories

This week went fine.  I found myself not getting as much done as I'd like to get done for 
the project but that is fine.  I'm hoping I can allot more time to the project next week.
